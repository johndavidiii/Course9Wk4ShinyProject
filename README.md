Ths is my Course 9, Week 4 Shiny Project
The app is on the Shiny server and so will be the Presentation. 
The Presentation will also be in the Githun repo located at
   https://github.com/johndavidiii/Course9Wk4ShinyProject
The Shiny web site is https://jhucoursera.shinyapps.io/deliverables/
Its a simple app and is self explainitory however there is documentation,i.e. the presentation,  that will help as well
